#### How to play Minesweeper 

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle-solving logic game played on a grid-like board. The user attempts to figure out where within the grid there are hidden “mines” planted by the Empire to be avoided. As the user “digs up” more of the board, numbers are revealed indicating the number of adjacent mines to a given square. Using this information, the player will deduce where the hidden “mines” are, while avoiding them. The key to winning the game is to open all the safe squares without detonating a mine. 

Our version of the game offers the user multiple customizable configurations, allowing them to tweak the difficulty of the board and game to their wishes. The core gameplay of our game will be the player entering values representing grid coordinates, accompanied by specific flags or keywords to indicate which action (“digging”, “flagging”, etc) they wish to perform on the coordinate-specified square.
